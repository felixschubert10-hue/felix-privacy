  <h1>Privacy Policy – EngagementPump</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: <span id="d"></span></p>

  <p>
    EngagementPump (“the App”) is a tool that helps creators manage Instagram interactions
    (e.g., auto-replies to comments/DMs, moderation, and scheduled publishing).
    This policy explains what data we process, why, and how you can exercise your rights.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      Controller: <strong>Felix Schubert</strong><br>
      Email: <a href="mailto:felixschubert10@gmail.com">felixschubert10@gmail.com</a>
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Data we access/process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instagram account identifiers that you connect to the App (Page ID, Instagram User ID).</li>
    <li>Public interactions the App receives via Meta Webhooks and APIs:
      comments, comment metadata, basic profile username of the commenter,
      direct messages you receive, and message metadata.</li>
    <li>Content you choose to schedule/publish through the App (media URL, caption, first comment, publish time).</li>
    <li>Technical logs needed to operate and secure the service (timestamps, event types, delivery status, errors).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use the data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To detect intent (e.g., question/praise/toxicity) and send your configured auto-replies.</li>
    <li>To moderate interactions you enable (e.g., hide toxic comments).</li>
    <li>To schedule and publish content on your connected Instagram account(s).</li>
    <li>To provide basic analytics and reliability (event logs, success/failure).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal basis</h2>
  <p>We process data you connect to the App based on your consent and our legitimate interest in providing the service you request.</p>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data. We share data only with service providers strictly necessary to run the App
    (e.g., Meta Platforms for Instagram Graph API, hosting providers). These providers process data under contractual safeguards.
  </p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Operational logs and interaction records are kept for up to 180 days by default, or less if you delete them sooner.
    Scheduled posts are kept until published and then archived for your records unless you delete them.
  </p>

  <h2>Your rights</h2>
  <p>
    You can request access, correction, deletion, restriction, or portability of your data at any time by emailing
    <a href="mailto:felixschubert10@gmail.com">felixschubert10@gmail.com</a>.
    You can also disconnect the App’s access to your accounts in Facebook/Instagram settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use HTTPS, access tokens, and least-privilege access. Secrets are stored as environment variables.
    No payment data is processed by the App.
  </p>

  <h2 id="data-deletion">Data deletion</h2>
  <p>
    To delete data processed by EngagementPump, email <a href="mailto:felixschubert10@gmail.com">felixschubert10@gmail.com</a>
    with the subject “Data Deletion – EngagementPump”. We will delete App-stored data associated with your accounts and confirm the deletion.
    You can also revoke the App’s permissions in Facebook → Settings → Business Integrations, and Instagram → Settings → Apps and Websites.
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for adults and is not directed to children under 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy as our service evolves. We will post changes here and update the “Last updated” date.
  </p>
